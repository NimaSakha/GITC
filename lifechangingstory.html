          Gyumri, Armenia’s second-largest city, is a centuries-old cultural
          hub. Armenians have populated this ancient city since the 5th century
          B.C. In modern times, Gyumri has been known for its arts,
          manufacturing and craftsmanship.<br /><br />

          The city was badly devastated by a crippling earthquake in 1988, which
          killed between 25,000 – 50,000 and injured over 100,000 people.
          Although it had many important institutions of higher learning, the
          earthquake and the changes in Armenia’s economy following its
          independence from the Soviet Union in 1989, left few opportunities for
          local employment and forced many young people to emigrate to Yerevan
          and abroad.
          <br /><br />
          A group of young, diasporan professionals, visiting the region through
          the Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR), conceived the potential to drive
          positive economic outcomes through technology, and conceptualized an
          educational program with a focus on computer programming and
          engineering.
          <br /><br />
          The Gyumri IT Center (GITC) was created in 2005 to provide educational
          opportunities for local students interested in computer programming,
          design, science and math. The goal of GITC is to leverage technology
          education to provide long-term employment opportunities in the region.
          <br /><br />
          Most GITC students are post-graduates who are looking to advance their
          engineering and computer programming skills en route to a full-time
          career.
          <br /><br />
          Most students attend GITC for free or are heavily subsidized, and
          graduates are expected to reimburse a portion of their tuition after
          earning a full-time salary.
          <br /><br />
          Between 2005 and 2022, GITC educated over 10,000 local Armenian
          students and has recently scaled its operations to all regions of
          Armenia. Since its founding in 2005, over 10+ technology start-ups and
          technology firms have opened offices in the region, with ties to GITC.
          <br /><br />
          The next chapter of growth includes collaborating with international
          organizations like the European Union (EU), the United States Agency
          for International Development (USAID), the German Agency for
          International Cooperation (GIZ) and others to promote digital skills
          and solutions across additional sectors of Armenia’s economy.
